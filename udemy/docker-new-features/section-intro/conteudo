In the Summer of 2019 I hosted an online event where Docker employees and Captains showed off their favorite features of the new 19.03 release. I've broken that event into shorter topic-focused videos, including Q&A, and added them here as Lectures.

I'm very excited about the 19.03 release and think it's the biggest Docker update in years. I hope you enjoy!
