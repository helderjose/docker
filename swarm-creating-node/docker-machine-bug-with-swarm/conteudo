Docker Machine Bug With Swarm
If you're planning to use docker-machine to create local VM's for Swarm, note there is a bug in 18.09.0 that prevents Swarm network ports from listening. This is fixed in 18.09.1 so make sure you have the latest Docker Desktop or Docker Toolbox and your VM's are up to date.

Current versions (October 2019) include:

docker version 19.03.2

docker-machine version 0.16.2

To ensure you have the latest Docker Toolbox, download it from the GitHub release page.

You'll know you're up to date when you do a docker-machine ls and the VM's have 18.09.1 or later.

To update existing docker-machine VM's, you can use docker-machine upgrade <name of vm>.
